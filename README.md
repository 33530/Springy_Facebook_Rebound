## About Facebook Rebound

<a href="http://facebook.github.io/rebound">Rebound</a> is a java library that
models spring dynamics. Rebound spring models can be used to create animations
that feel natural by introducing real world physics to your application.

Rebound is not a general purpose physics library; however, spring dynamics
can be used to drive a wide variety of animations. The simplicity of Rebound
makes it easy to integrate and use as a building block for creating more
complex components like pagers, toggles, and scrollers.
